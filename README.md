# FYP2_Plant-Disease-Detection-Dataset_Working-
"The PlantVillage dataset is a collection of over 50,000 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, specifically curated to help in diagnosing plant diseases using machine learning and computer vision techniques. It aims to combat the significant yield losses in crops caused by diseases, which currently reduce potential crop yields by an average of 40%. With the proliferation of smartphones, this dataset presents an opportunity to empower farmers worldwide, especially in developing regions, by enabling mobile disease diagnostics. The dataset is available on Kaggle, offering a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on agricultural technologies. You can access the dataset here on Kaggle".
